    <h1>Honey bees</h1>
    <h2>How they produce Honey?</h2>
    <b>nectar collection:</b>
    <p> Worker bees collect nectar from flowers using their long tongues and store it in their "honey
    stomach".
    </p>
    <b>Nectar Transformation:</b>
    <p> Upon returning to the hive, they regurgitate the nectar and pass it to other worker bees, who
    chew it and mix it with enzymes, altering its chemical composition.
    </p>
    <b>Evaporation:</b>
    <p> The bees then spread the nectar throughout the hive, allowing it to dehydrate and reduce its water content,
    which helps in the formation of honey.
    </p>
    <b>Storage</b>
    <p> Finally, the honey is stored in honeycomb cells and capped with wax for preservation.<br>
    This process ensures that bees have a food source during the winter months when flowers are scarce.</p>
    <h2>Fun facts</h2>
